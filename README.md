common
======

This is my personal framework that I use for most of my websites. The 
goal is not to make a huge framework like Symfony, but to have something 
faster and easier to modify. Therefore, I'm not aiming to make people 
use my framework, but to allow them to check out the source code and use
some of it for their own projects.

Features
======

Here are some features that are supported:

* easy multi website capabilities
* simple overall architecture for better performance
* simple MySQL interactions
* simple routing
* integrates the Twig template engine
* MVC architecture
* abstract authentication system
* admin panel for all applications

The whole framework is highly inspired by Symfony, while staying a lot simpler and less powerful.
